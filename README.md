# To run
Assuming all the files are there (the forest-theme folder contains two subfolders [forest-light, forest-dark], the icons file contains 10 files, this folder contains 4 Python files, two external files [api_key, settings]), then running it should be pretty simple.

If you do not have Python installed, install it. This project doesn't work without it.

Install dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can run `python main.py` to run the app, whenever.
